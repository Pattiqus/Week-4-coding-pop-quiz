<h1>Coding Pop Quiz!</h1>
<body>
This repository contains the source code for a coding pop quiz which is dynamically enabled with Javascript.

The player begins by clicking the start button, the timer in the top right corner begins to cound down and and the  player is presented with a series of questions. A correct answer leads to the next questions, an incorrect answer leads to the next question but also subtracts 20 seconds from the timer.

Once all questions are answered, the final time on the timer is the players score. They are then able to put their name into a form and the score will be posted to a scoreboard.
